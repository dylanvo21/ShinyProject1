# ShinyProject1
First RShiny Project
This is my first Shiny project for UIC CS 424. To Run you can either go to this link: https://dylanvo21.shinyapps.io/Project1/
or you can download the source code on this repo. You will need a browser as well as R studio to run this code. 



This is a web application that takes data from csv files off the epa.gov (https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html).
I manipulated the data to create pie charts and Bar graphs to display information about air quality dating back to the 1980s.
Currently you are only able to view the data for cook county. Future implementations may be incoming.
Enjoy!
